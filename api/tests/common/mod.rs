//!   - A running instance of the API server for testing
//!   - Helper methods for making authenticated HTTP requests
//!   - Request/response type definitions for all API endpoints
//!   - Methods to create, read, update, and delete resources
//!
//! - `database`: Database configuration utilities that:
//!   - Set up test databases with proper configuration
//!   - Handle database migrations

//!
//! These utilities help maintain consistency across tests and reduce code duplication.
